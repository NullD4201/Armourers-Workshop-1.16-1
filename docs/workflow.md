# Current Workflow

Lately we're working on updating the code into 1.16.5 Forge.

Since the Forge Mod Loader(a.k.a. `FML`)'s API code has greatly changed, we have to resolve the dependencies from old to new.
> In some parts, we should even **rewrite** the code since the old code is not supported after the migration.

Also, the native **Minecraft**'s code was changed alot too, but they're easier than FML because the internal code of API has not changed that much.

## Code Migrates

This repo will not be updated until the first successful build is up.

We've migrated the entire code to [here](https://github.com/AW16-port/Armourers-Workshop-1.16/tree/Experiment(pre-Alpha)),
and further test builds will be on there.

On there, we've updated some non-code sources that is now avaliable to use in 1.13+.

Contribution onto both repositories are always welcome.
