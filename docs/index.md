This is the project of porting [Armourer's Workshop by RiskyKen](https://github.com/RiskyKen/Armourers-Workshop)(*[Fork](https://github.com/JeonDohyeon/Armourers-Workshop)*) into **Minecraft 1.16.5**, the latest huge Minecraft version until 1.17.

## Why 1.16.5?

You can wonder why I decided to port this old code into 1.16.5, not 1.17/1.18 or 1.14~1.16.4. <br>
The answer's simple: **Most of the mods has ported to this wonderful and stable version of Minecraft**. <br>
Also, since 1.17 the code of building mods is completely different, so it's difficult to build.

## Features

The port will have every features out from AW 1.12.2, the latest version for the latest supportive version.
